ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mahesh, a Genesys Cloud Engineer with a passion for architecting and delivering innovative contact center solutions. 
Currently, I work at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), where I lead the development and deployment of Genesys Cloud contact center applications. I design end-to-end contact center solutions, from voicebot/IVR development to SIP optimization and cloud integration, ensuring seamless user experiences and business outcomes.
Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals on cloud engineering and contact center innovations. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about Genesys Cloud, automation, or anything tech-related! -
